Most music-lovers certainly intend to do so, but unfortunately almost always they are haphazard in carrying out this aspiration. Systematic collection means not only that they assure themselves of a record library of which they can be proud but that they can do so at an IMMENSE SAVING. The one-year membership offer made here is a dramatic demonstration. In the first year it represents a saving of AS MUCH AS 33% over the manufacturer's nationally advertised price.\nAfter purchasing the six additional records called for in this trial membership, members who continue can build up their record libraries ait almost a one-third SAVING through the Club's Record-Dividend plan; that is, for every two records purchased (from a group of at least 100 made available annually by the Society) members receive a third rca Victor Red Seal record FREE.\nA cardinal feature of the plan is GUIDANCE. The Society has a Selection Panel whose sole function is to recommend \"must-have\" works for members. Members of the panel are: DEEMS\nTAYLOR, composer and commentator, Chairman; JACQUES BARZUN, author and music critic; SAMUEL CHOTZINOFF, General Music Director, nbc; JOHN M.

Systematic collection means not only that they assure themselves of a record library of which they can be proud but that they can do so at an IMMENSE SAVING.

In the first year it represents a saving of AS MUCH AS 33% over the manufacturer\u2019s nationally advertised price.\nAfter purchasing the six additional records called.for in this trial membership, members who continue can build up their record libraries at almost a ONE-THIRD SAVING through the Club\u2019s Record-Dividend plan; that is, for every two \u2019 records purchased (from a group of at least 100 made available annually by the Society) members receive a third RCA Victor Red Seal record FREE.\nA cardinal feature of the plan is GUIDANCE.

Thereafter, through a unique Record-Dividend plan, continuing members can build their record library at almost a ONE-THIRD SAVING. For every two records purchased (from at least 50 available each year) members will receive a third RCA Victor Red Seal Record free.\nTbfl Cliburn\nTCHAIKOVSKY\ufffdS FIRST PIANO CONCERTO\nA cardinal feature of the plan is GUIDANCE. A selection panel, comprised of ten eminent music authorities, recommends \"must-have\" works to subscribers. The panel consists of university professors, composers, music critics and editors. The chairman is DEEMS TAYLOR.\nrr-iHis is one of the most exciting recordings 1 of a great musical classic that has been released in many years. A current selection of the Society, it is the first performance ever recorded by the lanky young Texan who, a few months ago, shot into the international limelight when he won the famous Tchaikovsky Piano Competition in Moscow, playing this work, among others. If you would like to begin your membership with this unusual recording, please check the box on the order card at right.\nEach month, three or more 12-inch 33>S R. P. M. RCA Victor Red Seal Records are announced to members. One is always singled out as the record-of-the-month and, unless the Society is otherwise instructed (on a simple form always provided), this record will be sent to the member. If he wishes, he may specify an alternate, or instruct the Society to send him nothing. For every record purchased, members pay \\$4.98 (the nationally advertised price), plus a small charge for postage and handling."

            "RCA VICTOR and Book-of-the-Month Club\nANNOUNCE THE FORMATION OF\nSheRG Victor _ Society pf threat SMusic ... its common-sense purpose is to help serious lovers of music build up a fine record library systematically instead of haphazardly.\nBy doing so, they can save ALMOST ONE third of what they would pay otherwise for the same RCA VICTOR Red Seal Records.\nAS THE HEART AND CORE OF A LIFETIME RECORD LIBRARY\nBEGINNING MEMBERS WHO AGREE TO BUY SIX RCA VICTOR RED SEAL RECORDS FROM THE SOCIETY DURING THE NEXT YEAR WILL RECEIVE\nThe Nine Beethoven Symphonies\n\u2014\u2014e a-xsS\nJirturoToscanini\nCONDUCTING THE NBC SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\nIN AN ALBUM OF SEVEN 12-INCH LONG-PLAYING RECORDS FOR\n8398\nadvertised price $34.98\nHost music-lovers, in the back of their minds, certainly intend to build up for themselves a representative record library of the World\u2019s Great Music. Unfortunately, almost always they are haphazard in carrying out this aspiration. The new Society is designed to meet this common situation, sensibly, by making collection more systematic than it now is in most cases.\n> Because of more systematic collection, operating costs can be greatly reduced, thus permitting extraordinary economies for the record collector. The remarkable\nIntroductory Offer at the left is a dramatic demonstration. It represents a 45% saving the first year. > Thereafter, continuing members can build their record library at almost a ONE-THIRD SAVING. For every two records purchased (from a group of at least fifty made available annually by the Society) members will receive a third rca Victor Red Seal Record free.\n> A cardinal feature of the plan is GUIDANCE. The Society has a Selection Panel whose sole business it is to determine \u201cmust-have\u201d works for members. Members of the panel are as follows:\nDEEMS TAYLOR, composer and commentator, Chairman. SAMUEL CHOTZINOFF, General Music Director, nbc JACQUES BARZUN, author and music critic\nJOHN M. CONLY, editor of High Fidelity\nAARON COPLAND, composer\nALFRED FRANKENSTEIN, music critic of San Francisco Chronicle DOUGLAS MOORE, composer and Professor of Music, Columbia University WILLIAM SCHUMAN, composer and president of Juilliard School of Music CARLETON SPRAGUE SMITH, chief of Music Division, N. Y. Public Library G. WALLACE WOODWORTH, Professor of Music, Harvard University\nHOW THE SOCIETY OPERATES\nEach month, three or more rca\nVictor Red Seal Records will be announced to members. One will always he singled out as the record-of-the-month, and unless the Society is otherwise instructed (on a simple form always provided), this record will be sent to the member. If the\nmember does not want the work he may specify an alternate, or instruct the Society to send him nothing. For every record purchased, members will pay only $4.98, the nationally advertised price of rca Victor Red Seal Records (plus a small charge for postage and handling).\nRCA VICTOR Society of Great Music, c/o Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc., 345 Hudson St., New York 14, N. Y.\nPlease register me as a member and send me the seven-record Toscanini-Beethoven Album under the conditions stated at the left billing me $3.98, plus postage. If I continue, after buying six records, for every\ntwo records I purchase from the Society, I will receive a third rca Victor Record, free. To maintain membership after the first year, I need buy only four records from the Society in any 12-month period.\nmr. )\nmrs. ; _____________________________________________________________________________________\nMISS ) (Please print plainly)\nADDRESS.............___________________________________________________________________________________\nCITY...,._____________________________________________________.........ZONE........STATE...,....\nNOTE: If you wish to enroll through an authorized RCA VICTOR dealer, please fill in here:\nDEALER\u2019S NAME______________________________________________________________________....\nADDRESS..................................__________________________\nCITY, ZONE STATE V186-7................................................................................ ..........",
